# pinterest-feed-clone
I used Bolt.new to replicate my Pinterest feed. The first attempt had placeholders instead of images, but updating the prompt fixed this. A mock AI feature was added to summarize the feed with insights on trends, categories, and sponsored posts. Minor image issues remained, but overall, it worked well.

Full Description: 

I used Bolt.new to replicate my Pinterest home feed based on a screenshot and prompt. The first attempt successfully cloned the layout and structure but ran into issues with the images—most were replaced with placeholders like "image 1" and their titles. This problem affected about eight instances in the feed. On my second try, I updated the prompt to include the actual images, and the results were much better. The clone displayed real images and even featured a functional-looking save button. However, I couldn’t actually save or pin any of the images.

To test out a new feature, I prompted Bolt.new with: “Can you create a mock AI feature that summarizes the pins on the home feed? Make sure you can tell that it is not a pin or part of the feed, but still uses Pinterest colors.” In the final result, Bolt added a “feed insights” section at the top. This section summarized the content on my feed, highlighting things like the number of 2025 trend items, content categories, and sponsored posts. While the update was a success overall, there were still one or two images displaying as “class” instead of actual visuals. Other than that, Bolt did a great job of recreating and customizing my Pinterest feed.
